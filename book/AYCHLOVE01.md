Good Day to You
29 Beautiful Stories That Will Restore Your Faith in HumanityMorning commutes can be the bane of city dwellers’ existences, but not for commuters at the Armitage train station in Chicago. In the coldest of winter mornings, Janet Martin, with the Chicago Transit Authority, mans the turnstiles, welcoming customers with a huge smile.

Slowly, zombielike commuters open their eyes, lift their chins and rip out their headphones to return her greeting.

“Good morning, everyone! Have a fantastic day!” Janet bellows. She’s eager to help someone with questions or a problem.

Janet has given me pep talks for job interviews and has helped me when I have forgotten my train pass. If it’s a rainy day, she asks me if I’ve packed my umbrella.

When I moved and took a different train, my commutes were lackluster without Janet. When I returned, she embraced me like an old friend.

“You’re back!” she exclaimed. “Welcome home.”

Yes, I was home.
