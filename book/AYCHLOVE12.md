Unsolicited Help

A Sudanese woman, Alik, who was pregnant and had two young children in tow, arrived in Fort Worth, Texas, without her husband, Dyan, in 2012. Upon leaving their refugee camp in Egypt, Dyan wasn’t able to make the journey with his family because the couple had no official proof of their marriage with them. Alik was processed as a single mother, which bumped her to the top of the resettlement list, and her husband, a single man, was moved down to the bottom.

Over the next four years, two women with The Village Church in Fort Worth helped Alik and her children get their lives started in the U.S. The women also called congressional representatives, spoke with attorneys and met with social workers in an attempt to help Dyan come to the U.S.

After four years, Dyan was finally reunited with his wife and three children, including the baby Alik was pregnant with when she left. Video footage shows Dyan dropping to his knees in a tearful prayer of thanksgiving after being reunited with his family.
