A Ripple of Hope
When Aidan Thomas Anderson got involved with charity work at age 8, he thought he’d be inspiring his generation to give back.

“But adults are coming into the picture,” says the now 16-year-old, who speaks and performs music at corporate events for up to 10,000 people. “The need is so great for people to learn how to give.”

By year’s end, he will have worked with 500 charities thanks to his Aidan Cares movement that helps others find their passion for service. He’s also spoken alongside Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, has given his own TEDx Talk and released a single on iTunes. “We don’t need to be a big deal,” insists the teen. “Just a ripple.”
