Sunshine on a Ranney Day

In 2012 Holly Ranney combined her background in interior design with her husband’s construction expertise to give an 11-year-old cancer patient in Macon, Georgia, a bedroom makeover they paid for themselves. His reaction to the room changed the couple’s lives.

“Pete and I looked at each other and said, ‘Wow, this is definitely something we were meant to do,’ ” Holly says. Today the duo heads up Sunshine on a Ranney Day, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that offers free makeovers of child bedrooms, therapy rooms and bathrooms for kids with long-term illnesses.

“A lot of these families don’t feel like they deserve it or think that there are others out there who need it more than them,” Holly says. With the support of generous sponsors, volunteers and donors, the couple has overseen more than 50 makeovers, giving families under incredible stress a huge home blessing and a new reason to smile.
