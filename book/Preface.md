#  A Brief of AYCHLOVE Program

The AYCHLOVE program is some participation of social development program. It is an initiative taken from some issues.
The main concern arisen from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCS), with about 43 countries as sorted by UNTAD. Let's use L43 as an abbreviation for this group.
It has some reason to look at L43 GDP with its less than 2%.

Then, there may have some topics presented here for whom may it concern as follows:
If the L43 would increase its GDP to 7% by 2030 from the current amount of less than 2% in 2020, it could increase its GDP to 10% by 2040 from its 7%.

If the L43 would ensure its people with at least two healthy meals per day by 2030, it could ensure its people with at least three healthy and the healthiest meals per day by 2040.

If the L43 would get its people sheltered for 70% by 2030, it could get its people sheltered for 100% by 2040.
