Scrolling for Kindness

Intrigued, I turned on the sound to hear the voice of Khloe Thompson, a then-9-year-old humanitarian who donates hygiene essentials to women in need. She delivers them in colorful, handmade totes called Kare Bags, which contain things like soap, toothpaste and deodorant.

Witnessing her charity work, Khloe Kares, in action restored my faith in the human heart.
