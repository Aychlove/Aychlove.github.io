Lending a Helping Hand

Impressed by his work ethic, Derrick Taylor’s UPS co-workers pooled their resources to buy the Alabama teen a Jeep Cherokee. Not wanting to burden or rely on others for rides, the teen had been walking his approximately 10-mile roundtrip commute to work—much in darkness—for more than a year. Taylor, 19, had been working since the age of 14 to support his sick mother. He was moved to tears by his colleagues’ gesture.
