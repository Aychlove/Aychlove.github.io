A Rescue Mission

Dogs that have been beaten, abused, run over by cars or left to die with massive tumors have a guardian angel and advocate in their corner—Jennifer Smith. Her Noah’s Arks Rescue charity pays the medical, rehabilitation and caregiving costs for dogs that otherwise would be euthanized, spending an average of $20,000 per animal. Thanks to numerous small donations and an undisclosed amount Smith kicks in, Noah’s Arks Rescue drops around $1.5 million each year to make miracles happen for these pups.

And when a dog can’t be saved, they throw a party for it before they say goodbye.

“When that dog passes,” Smith says, “he’s gonna have so much love around him that he’s gonna think he lived his whole life this way.”
