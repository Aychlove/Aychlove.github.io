Walking Tall

In the summer of 2010, Chris Leeuw took a break from kayaking to climb a truss bridge and dive into a deep southern Indiana river. Ten seconds later, he couldn’t feel anything from the neck down. Another guy had jumped with Leeuw and drifted over mid-fall, landing on Leeuw’s neck and leaving the 28-year-old a quadriplegic by the time he surfaced. In the ensuing weeks and months, the wheelchair-bound Leeuw traversed a dizzying network of hospitals, outpatient centers and nursing homes, but found the maze of his care complicated, expensive and not focused enough on his goal: walking again.

Low on traditional options, Leeuw discovered Neuroworx, a low-cost therapy center in Utah, founded by a former quadriplegic, that allowed him to recuperate at his own pace for a tiny fraction of what traditional care would have cost. Eighteen months after his accident, Leeuw walked again. And in 2015, fueled by the revelatory experience, he opened NeuroHope, a low-cost clinic near downtown Indianapolis that provides affordable therapy, equipment and facilities to patients with spinal cord and other neurological injuries.

In the past two years, the facility has expanded twice, received a state grant to expand its services and spearheaded legislation that funds affordable long-term therapy programs. “We’ve helped 36 patients on their road to recovery,” Leeuw says—a road that still stretches on.
