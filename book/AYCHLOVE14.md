Relationship Goals

As the sister of a brother with Asperger’s syndrome, love stories like that of Florida couple Nico Morales and Latoya Jolly are by far my favorite kind. After meeting on a dating site for those on the autism spectrum, the two connected quickly and built a deep relationship based on mutual understanding and support. Morales describes their dynamic as being “even more extraordinary together.”
