All Dogs Go to Heaven

More people are adopting or fostering old dogs than ever. One such dog is Danny Boy, an Australian cattle dog diagnosed with blood cancer after landing at Muttville Senior Dog Rescue in San Francisco. Foster parents Russell Utley and Marie Macaspac checked off a bucket list for the pup. They took happy-go-lucky Danny to Half Moon Bay, California, to eat crabs bought off a boat, dressed him for fancy fundraisers, fed him homemade food and took road trips. Given three to six months to live, Danny stretched that to 15 months. In that time, Danny transformed the lives of his owners. “Old dogs have a wonderful spirit,” says Utley, who now fosters 16-year-old blind and deaf Chachito for Muttville, which pays for veterinary care and last year found hospice homes for 85 dogs. Senior dog rescue groups have popped up around the country in the past decade. The Thulani Program in California has saved more than 290 senior German shepherd dogs to date, with a goal of finding homes for 100 every year, says director Bob Jachens.
