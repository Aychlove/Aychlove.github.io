Silent Struggles
A poem for a stranger

There is a man she sees weekly, when he visits her café,
She hears the girls whisper “tall, dark, and handsome,” though she doesn’t see him in this way.
A grin from ear to ear, and always a pleasant thing to say,
She found that simply his presence alone could salvage greatness within her day.

Yet there are times when he looks troubled, and once she was brave enough to ask why,
He said his grandmother was very ill and his family struggles to get by.
A shock because from appearances, he always looked just fine,
Nice hair, a job and an AMEX, who would guess he had problems of this kind.

Months passed and she noticed his lighthearted manner with customers or the occasional friend in town,
Stuck behind a digital highlight reel, it was nearly impossible to spot the thorn in his crown.
One afternoon, while mopping the floor, she overheard a phone call that left him in a terrible frown,
Insurance asking for more money than he had, and her heart began to drown.

She dashed to the bar and on his cup, scribbled a sharpie note spiraled all around,
Then handed his drink with a closed-lipped smile, not making a single sound.
He looked as his chaotic cup puzzled, struggling to understand,
She pointed for him to read it with a swift gesture of her hand.

The words looked a little bit awkward, some letters squished and not lined up just right,
But to the man in the café this message changed his thoughts on what people call love at first sight:

“I want to thank you, brother, for everything that you do,
But especially for being gentle and patient when people assume things of you.
Like when you smile from your lips to your eyes, and they believe you’ve never felt “real pain,”
They see you standing so strong, they cannot imagine you so low as having to crawl 
through mud and rain.

You carry this invisible burden, brother, and never speak of it aloud,
Because the fact that you carry it is not of something you are proud.
Though you’ve accepted the cards you’ve been dealt with, you wish that people knew,
How much more effort the world demands for just simply being you.

But I want you to know, I see you, brother, for ALL that you are,
And be proud to know that to some you shine brighter than the other stars.
Because you’ve not lost temper or heart, even though yes, the system is flawed,
10,000 hours just to be equal, 10,000 more to hear the applause.

So all I ask is that as you open the door and begin to start your day,
You say to yourself and truly believe, “I am already a success story today.”

With watery eyes they smiled, he opened his mouth but she insisted, “You don’t need to say a word.
This life is about feeling connected and seen, not just about being heard.”
He nodded right then and he kissed her, ever so softly on the cheek,
Replying, “I have not the words to express how grateful I am, sister, that our paths allowed us to meet.”

They do not speak that often, but when they converse it is quite grand,
Much deeper than quiet pleasantries and a soft shake of the hand.
They share of dreams and struggles openly, and never is their talk just small,
How wasted this life would be if we didn’t tend to the roots that help us grow tall.

They laugh, they cry, they hug, and always before they part,
They look at each other slyly and say, “Thank you for letting me see you today;
truly from the bottom of my heart.”
